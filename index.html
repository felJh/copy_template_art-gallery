                    <i>Artist who made his name as a portrait painter – depicting actors, politicians and several
                        members
                        of the royal family</i>
                </p>
                <p>The artist Michael Noakes, who has died aged 84, turned high society portraiture into a home
                    industry. During a career of more than 60 years, he painted actors, scientists, broadcasters, church
                    leaders, presidents, prime ministers and members of the royal family, often from the comfort of his
                    family home in St John’s Wood, north London, with many of the resulting portraits hanging in the
                    National Portrait Gallery, as well as the British Museum and the House of Commons.</p>

            <div class="s4-txt">
                <p>Michael made his name in 1972 with a commission from the Corporation of London to paint seven members
                    of the royal family, including the Queen. Initially discomposed by the prospect of measuring a
                    monarch with a felt-tip pen, Michael adapted quickly and was soon seen on the steps of No 10,
                    recording the dimensions for a life-size trompe-l’oeil portrait of Margaret Thatcher. Controversial
                    sitters inspired a mixed reception, with one painting of the former prime minister declared both
                    “radiant” by the art dealer and broadcaster Philip Mould, and “lifeless” by the Guardian writer
                    Jonathan Jones, but overall the artist enjoyed a reputation for being a traditionalist with an
                    innovative streak.</p>
